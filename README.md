# Computer Systems Organization : Recitation 05

## Bitwise Operations

In this set of exercises you will get some experience using the bitwise
operators in C.

### Exercises

* Fill in the TODO's starting at part01.c and working your way up to part11.c
* Commit and push these changes to your Github repository.


#### Tip

To quickly compile and test to execute the code to see if the tests pass use a command like the following...  

```
gcc util.c part0X.c && ./a.out
```

.. where X is the part number. This command is saying "If compilation is successful, execute the code."

When you think you have all the tests passing you can run the `test-all.sh` script.

```
./test-all.sh
```
